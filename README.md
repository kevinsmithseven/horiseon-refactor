# Horiseon Refactor For Accessibility

## Description

This project is a refactoring of the Horiseon website in order to increase accessibility features. This will allow that all potential users, including those with disabilities, will have a decent user experience and are able to easily access the information. 

In completing this project, I learned the importance of meaningful "alt" text linked to images in order to increase accessibility and increase image traffic.

## Usage

Below is an image of the refactored website. Users will be able to click on each of the three links in the navigation area at the top and right of the page to be able to navigate to the details for each section below.
